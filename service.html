                    <em class="text-start">Social media marketing is creating and sharing content on different platforms
                        for audiences to promote a business's
                        products or services, engage with customers, and build brand awareness. The rise of the internet
                        and online sharing gave
                        birth to social media marketing in the early 2000s. Platforms like MySpace (2003) and Facebook
                        (2004) were some early
                        social media platforms focused on connecting people. The landscape rapidly transformed from
                        text-based posts to the use
                        of images, videos, and live streaming. Visual storytelling emerged as a powerful tool for
                        captivating audiences and
                        driving engagement. As social media matured, data analytics became indispensable for marketers.
